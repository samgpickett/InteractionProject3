    <p>The worldview of National Socialism is today the common property of the whole <a href="javascript:void(0)" onmouseover="toggle_visibility('popupBoxOnePosition');">German</a> people. All unprejudiced citizens of good will have madev National Socialist thinking so deeply their own that it provides answers for every question of life and direction for every action.</p>

    <p>This shared National Socialist worldview makes it possible for German citizens to participate actively in the formation of our national life. Regardless of his position, each <a href="javascript:void(0)" onmouseover="toggle_visibility('popupBoxOnePosition');">German</a> can through thought and deed participate in political, cultural, and economic renewal. This common worldview is the unbreakable bond that holds together the leadership and the followers of our people in their common labor.</p>

    <p>In the past there was no such general involvement of all citizens in forming our political life. There was a deep chasm between the “rulers” and the “subjects.” Even when we were under so-called democratic rule, the average citizen had no role in determining the fate of our people. Deep involvement and real participation by all <a href="javascript:void(0)" onmouseover="toggle_visibility('popupBoxOnePosition');">German</a> was impossible since in most cases only a small circle of the elite determined the direction the government should go. This was not only because the past lacked a unified and common worldview. The many so-called worldviews were sufficiently unclear and confused as to be unable to lead to a building of political will.</p>

            <div id= "third">
    <img src="Images/hitlerandyoungboy.jpg">
    <p>Former worldviews were not built on a recognition of reality and a knowledge of the facts. Rather, they were abstract theories unrelated to reality that had developed over the course of history. They had nothing to do with the real facts, and indeed often stood in sharp conflict with them. The conflict between theory and reality soon so confused all matters of national life that even the “leaders” of such worldview groups could make no order out of the confusion. The average <a href="javascript:void(0)" onmouseover="toggle_visibility('popupBoxOnePosition');">German</a> citizen could do no more than wait more or less patiently to see what resulted in the political realm. He was driven from the political stage into the audience. The exact opposite is the case today. All the questions of our political life are so clear, simple, and unified that each citizen can both understand them and work to solve them.</p>

    <p>The National Socialist worldview is not the result of abstract and convoluted thinking. It is not a theory, but rather is clearly bound to reality. <a href="javascript:void(0)" onmouseover="toggle_visibility('popupBoxOnePosition');">German</a> National Socialist thinking comes from experience. It is a worldview based on facts and reality.</p>

    <p>The most important and influential facts in the life of nations are “blood and soil.” He who understands their laws and effects in history can determine the future.
